#  Real-Time Chat App

A **simple and responsive real-time chat application** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO** that allows users to communicate instantly in private chat rooms. This project is perfect for learning about real-time web communication and understanding how sockets work under the hood.

##  Live Features

*  Real-time private messaging
*  Join/leave rooms dynamically
*  Message seen indicators
*  Fast, responsive communication (WebSockets)

##  Why I Built This

Many people rely on instant communication for collaboration, support, or simply staying in touch. I wanted to explore how technologies like **WebSockets** power modern tools like WhatsApp, Slack, or Discord.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

* Event-driven architecture
* Real-time communication systems
* Backend state management
* Scalability and clean socket lifecycle handling
